## 🎯 Planned Installation Options

Once active development commences, the project will be distributed via two primary channels:

### 1. Desktop Application (End-Users)
- **Target Audience:** Field researchers, ecologists, and data managers.
- **Distribution:** Self-contained, single-click native installers for **Windows**, **macOS**, and **Linux**.
- **Runtime:** **Zero dependencies required.** The application bundles all necessary components into a single executable—no separate Python, Docker, or Java installation needed.

### 2. Python Core Engine (Developers & Data Pipelines)
- **Target Audience:** Pipeline developers, bioinformaticians, and automated data workflows.
- **Distribution:** Published via PyPI as `fairmorph-engine` (or `fairfield-engine`).
- **Setup Target:**
  ```bash
  pip install fairmorph-engine
